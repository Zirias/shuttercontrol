## Shutter control simulation

This code is **private**. I'm adding it here as a backup. This is for
developing a simple bus system to control the shutters in a house. It
consists of a Qt based simulation GUI and AVR code for the single
microcontrollers for each shutter. The AVR code is to be executed using
[simavr](https://github.com/buserror/simavr) in threads.

So, if it is of *any* use for you, feel free to use the code you find here,
but **do not distribute** it. There won't be any distributions.
